### üî• FINAL DIRECTIVE TO THE AGENT:

> You've done great work adapting everything for static site generation ‚Äî especially with the `react-helmet-async` workaround and custom scripts.  
>
> **Now STOP patching and building.**  
> Time to **validate everything you‚Äôve built.**  
>  
> Run the following exact checklist. If any item fails ‚Äî don‚Äôt build more. Fix only what's broken.

### ‚úÖ SEO PRERENDERING FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

**1. Static Files Must Exist**
```sh
ls dist/
ls dist/zapchasti/
ls dist/zapchasti/sitrak/
```
All of these must show `.html` files. If any of them is missing ‚Üí generation failed.

---

**2. View HTML Output**
Run this:
```sh
cat dist/zapchasti/sitrak/index.html
```
You MUST see:
- `<title>` tag with brand name  
- `<meta name="description">`  
- Visible HTML content (like `<h1>`, product text)  
- `<script type="application/ld+json">` with Product, Breadcrumb, etc.

If you see just `<div id="root"></div>`, prerendering is still broken.

---

**3. Run Lighthouse & Rich Results Tests**

Run:
- https://search.google.com/test/rich-results on `/zapchasti/sitrak`
- Chrome DevTools > Lighthouse (Mobile, Performance + SEO)

Pass mark:
- ‚úÖ Product + Breadcrumb + AutoPartsStore are detected
- ‚úÖ SEO = 100
- ‚úÖ No ‚Äúpage is empty‚Äù errors

---

**4. Local Preview**
```sh
npx serve dist
```
Then:
- Visit `http://localhost:5000/zapchasti/sitrak`
- Disable JavaScript in browser ‚Üí **page still shows content**

If this works, **prerendering is verified**.

---

**5. Sitemap & robots.txt**
- Confirm `dist/sitemap.xml` exists and lists all `/zapchasti/<brand>` URLs
- Confirm `robots.txt` allows crawling
- Bonus: submit sitemap to Google + Yandex

---

Once these 5 pass ‚Äî you‚Äôre cleared for production.

If any one fails ‚Äî stop and debug. Do **not** continue building new things.

When he finishes that, send me the `view-source` output from one of the generated brand pages and I‚Äôll double-check it myself.
