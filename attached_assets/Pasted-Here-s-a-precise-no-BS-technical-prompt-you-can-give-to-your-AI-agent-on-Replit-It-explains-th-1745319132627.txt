Hereâ€™s a **precise, no-BS technical prompt** you can give to your AI agent on Replit. It explains the mission clearly, tells it what to do, what **not** to break, and how to verify the fix.

### âœ… TECHNICAL PROMPT FOR AGENT (SEO PRERENDERING FIX)

---

**Mission:**  
Our site `https://asiatek.pro` is currently rendered 100% client-side, which means SEO is broken â€” search engines see only a blank `<div id="root"></div>`. We need you to **enable static prerendering** using `vite-plugin-ssg`, but **without breaking any functionality or styling.**

---

### ðŸ“¦ What you need to do:

1. **Install required packages:**
```bash
npm install vite-plugin-ssg @vueuse/head
```

2. **Update `vite.config.ts`:**  
Add and configure `vite-plugin-ssg`. Ensure it's used only in **production** builds.

3. **Refactor the app entry point** to support SSG:  
You may need to wrap routing and app mounting inside a factory like:
```ts
export const createApp = () => {
  const app = createApp(App)
  const router = createRouter()
  app.use(router)
  return { app, router }
}
```

4. **Ensure all route pages (e.g., `/`, `/zapchasti`, `/zapchasti/sitrak`) are statically generated.**

5. **Generate HTML files via SSG:**
```bash
npm run build
# or custom: vite-ssg build
```

6. **Verify the output:**  
Each important route should produce an HTML file:
```
dist/index.html
dist/zapchasti/index.html
dist/zapchasti/sitrak/index.html
```

7. **Donâ€™t touch or break:**
- Any existing PWA service worker logic  
- Routing logic (including fallback routes)  
- App styling, layout, or animations  
- Meta tags or icon links  
- Email/Supabase/Webhook integrations  
- Production build & deploy scripts

---

### âœ… After finishing, confirm these:

- View-source of brand pages shows real content (`<title>`, `<h1>`, etc.), not just an empty root div
- Rich Results Test for `/zapchasti/sitrak` passes for `Product`, `Breadcrumb`, and `AutoPartsStore`
- `main.tsx` and all assets load with no 404s
- The app looks and works **identically** to before

---

> **DO NOT deploy until everything is verified locally or in staging.**  
> You break production, you fix it.

---

Let me know once itâ€™s ready â€” Iâ€™ll test the view-source and run rich results myself.
